The result of private equity ownership in companies caring for vulnerable populations is downright grisly, including deadly neglect and abuse in residential centers for the severely disabled, denying care to medicare and medicaid patients with life-threatening eating disorders, and padding bills for wheelchairs.



While we applaud the steps taken by the Biden administration to require a minimum staff-to-patient ratio in nursing homes, I believe the ratio MUST be stronger to protect patients and staff. 



Private equity companies are drawn to health care because of the opportunities they see in market failures, inconsistent payment policies, and lax regulation or enforcement that can be exploited for financial gain. In addition, the imperative of the PE business model is to boost profits quickly, often by reducing costs, which in a health care facility means cutting staff or shifting the balance of employees toward a lesser-skilled, lower-paid workforce.



CMS should be very sensitive to possibilities for gaming the staffing rule and take steps to close potential loopholes in the proposed rule. I urge CMS to:



- Adopt the highest possible minimum staffing levels and prevent gaming by setting standards for every level of clinical staff;



- Establish clear, measurable, and rigorous criteria for receiving an exemption from the requirements;



- Shorten the proposed implementation period, to preempt short-term PE exploitation before the rule takes effect; and 



- Support states in bolstering the depleted state survey agency workforce, to strengthen enforcement of the staffing requirements.

I'm Debbie Bohannon I've been in LTC for 10 plus years.  I got in this business to help the elderly and their families.  I work for The Springs of Arkansas and we have 23 buildings thru our Arkansas.  The residents mean the world to our buildings.  I'm the Regional Liaison for admissions.  In regards to the new CMS Guidelines for staffing must not be passed.  Since COVID staffing is a nightmare.  Our LPNS and all staff members are the back bone of our business .  If passed this industry will suffer and that means the elderly and families will suffer the most.  If possible phase it in over 5 years.  Please keep that in mind when decisions are being made.  Thanks so much.

"CMS-2023-0144-17861","I write to you, as a social worker, to comment on the proposed rule addressing nurse minimum staffing standards for long-term care facilities and Medicaid institutional payment transparency reporting (CMS–3442–P).

Social workers and interdisciplinary colleagues—including certified nursing assistants (CNAs), licensed practical nurses–licensed vocational nurses (LPNs–LVNs), and registered nurses (RNs)—strive to enhance the quality of life and quality of care for nursing home residents. Yet, their efforts are often hindered by exceedingly high workloads. I appreciate CMS’s efforts to establish minimum staffing standards for nursing disciplines. CMS’s proposed minimum nurse staffing standards of 2.45 hours per resident day (HPRD) of nurse aide care and 0.55 HPRD of RN care improve upon current regulation, which defers to each facility to determine “sufficient” staffing levels. However, these proposed standards are much lower than those supported by more than 20 years of research, and they would allow for a reduction in total staffing to levels below both prepandemic and May 2022 national staffing averages. I urge CMS to strengthen the proposed minimums by (1) increasing the minimum nurse aide standard to 2.45 CNA HPRD and specifying that the preceding standard applies specifically to CNAs, who meet federal training requirements and have state certifications that nurse aides may lack; (2) increasing the minimum RN staffing requirement to 0.75 HPRD; (3) adding a minimum standard of 1.4 licensed nursing (total RN and LPN–LVN) HPRD, thereby recognizing the unique contribution of each licensed nursing discipline to resident care; and (4) adding a total nursing staff minimum standard of 4.2 HPRD.

CMS’s proposal to require an RN onsite 24 hours per day, seven days per week is also a great improvement on the current regulation. I suggest that CMS strengthen the language by (1) requiring 24–7 RNs who provide care directly to residents onsite, not on call or as needed, and (2) clarifying that facilities cannot use nurses in administrative roles, such as director of nursing or MDS coordinator, to meet 24–7 RN direct care requirement.

The implementation and enforcement of a nurse minimum staffing standard is vital both to the biopsychosocial well-being of nursing home residents and to the safety and well-being of staff. I encourage CMS to strengthen its implementation plan in two ways: 
1. Eliminate hardship exemptions/waivers for facilities that cannot meet minimum nurse staffing standards, the 24–7 requirement, or both. Every nursing home resident deserves high-quality care, regardless of their geographic location or other factors. 
2. Implement all nurse staffing requirements within two years of the final rule and on the same timeline, regardless of geographic area; a phase-in of three to seven years is too long. Establish reasonable benchmarks for each year to help facilities meet the two-year goal.  
3. If a nursing home is unable to meet the minimum nurse staffing standards, place a hold on payment for new admissions until the problem is remedied. 

I also urge CMS to strengthen the federal requirements for social service staff in nursing homes. A 2022 report on nursing homes by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that every nursing home in the country hire at least one social worker, defined as a BSW or MSW and excluding any other academic discipline in the “human services field."" Staffing ratios for social workers also need to be improved; multiple studies have shown that the “120-bed rule” is insufficient. Consideration of the distinct and equally important needs of residents receiving and those in long-term care is essential in determining more appropriate staffing ratios.  

Every resident of every nursing home deserves access to a social worker, as defined by NASW and the National Academies, and to sufficient nursing care at all levels. Thank you for your leadership and your consideration of my input.",NA

I am very concerned about health care in this country and especially about understaffing in hospitals and nursing homes. As a senior citizen without children, I must face the possibility that I may at some point need to be in a nursing home. I have heard horror stories about people in these homes being neglected because of severe understaffing. I want to know that if I or any other person needs nursing home care, there will be enough people there to see to our needs. I am also concerned that staff be well paid and have good working conditions, as I know that will attract experienced staff and encourage people to stay in these difficult jobs.



Federal regulation of nursing home conditions is long overdue. I support strong regulation to ensure safety and good care in nursing homes.

I am deeply concerned about health care in this country and that includes the staffing crisis in our nation’s nursing homes. I worry that when the time comes, if I need care for myself or for someone that I love, there won’t be enough care workers or that experienced care workers will leave the bedside for other jobs. Federal regulations around safe staffing are long overdue, and it’s time we hold nursing homes accountable for their treatment of staff and residents.

Administrator Brooks-LaSure,



I am writing to support a national minimum staffing standard for nursing homes. This will improve working conditions and the quality of care for nursing home residents. It also will hold nursing home owners accountable for putting cost cutting and profits above patients and workers.



We all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. This is especially true for people who need nursing home care and those who do the important, challenging work of caring for them. The proposed rule is a good start.



I agree with requiring a registered nurse to always be on site. I also agree with setting staffing requirements for nurse aides and registered nurses. These are common-sense requirements.



You should also make the rule stronger. To do this, you should:



Require nursing homes to have a minimum number of licensed practical nurses or licensed vocational nurses (LPNs/LVNs). These health care professionals also provide valuable care in nursing homes.



Increase the minimum staffing requirement above what you have proposed. Taking good care of nursing home residents requires more staff to provide the basic support they need and deserve.



Make sure these requirements are enforced. Without that, a rule doesn’t mean much.



I urge you to make these changes and quickly put out a final rule.
